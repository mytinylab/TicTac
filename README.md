HTML tictactoe

You play against the computer. You place your piece first. At the moment, the computer plays badly. It places its piece in a random spot on the board.

To do:
1. allow you to choose who plays first.
2. add code to make the computer slowly learn from previous games/mistakes.
3. make the board prettier? Not sure if this one is worth doing...
